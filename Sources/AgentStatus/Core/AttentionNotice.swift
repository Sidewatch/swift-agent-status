/// reading herdr: it notifies for a blocked or finished pane and suppresses the popup for the
/// tab you are looking at). A notification is for a state the person cannot see: the app is in
/// the background, or the pane is not on screen. One is never posted for the pane in front of
/// them — the tab badge already says it.
